# DCCWebsite
Assignment 4

The PDFs were converted to CSV files using the code given in PDF to CSV py files (using FITZ as taught in class).

The CSV files were then imported into mysql directly under a new schema 'dccweb'.

The frontend was then connected to the backend using main.py and web.html.
